# MCMC for Low Photon Imaging

**Abstract:** In this work, we present a  new  and  highly  efficient  Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  methodology to perform Bayesian inference in low-photon imaging problems, with particular attention given tosituations involving observation noise processes that deviate significantly from Gaussian noise, such as binomial, geometric, and low-intensity Poisson noise.  These problems are challenging for many reasons.  From an inferential viewpoint, low-photon numbers lead to severe identifiability issues, poor stability, and high uncertainty about the solution.  Moreover, low-photon models often exhibit poor regularity  properties  that  make  efficient  Bayesian  computation  difficult,  e.g.,  hard  nonnegativity constraints, nonsmooth priors, and log-likelihood terms with exploding gradients.  We address these difficulties by proposing an MCMC methodology based on a reflected and regularized Langevin SDE, which is shown to bewell-posed and exponentially ergodic under mild and easily verifiable conditions.

**In this repository,** you can find the codes of our suggested reflected proximal Langevin MCMC algorithms to perform Bayesian computationin low-photon imaging problems. The proposed approach is demonstrated with a range of experiments related to image deblurring, denoising, and inpainting under binomial, geometric, and Poisson noise.
